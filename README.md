# Tarski Counter

This is a project to calculate the number of distinct Tarski's worlds, a configuration of an 8x8 board with objects of various shapes, sizes, and labels. We accomplished this by first calculating the number of distinct configurations containing only a large object, from there calculated the number of permutations of that configuration using all other variables.

# Number calculated from world_counter.py:
There are 182,744,627,306,952,241,483,578,822,124 tarski worlds. This number has 30 digits!
